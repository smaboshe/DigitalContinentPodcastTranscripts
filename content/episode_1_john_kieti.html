	<h2>Interview</h2>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Welcome everybody once again to the Digital Continent Podcast. I&rsquo;m still, for this episode, at the iHub, Nairobi, co-working space. And I could be here, actually, all week interviewing some really great developers, some really great businessmen. Great innovators, you&rsquo;ve already <strike>had</strike> heard a few of them that I&rsquo;ve talked to.</p>

	<p>Next up I&rsquo;m talking to John Kieti of m:lab. m:lab is, m:lab <em>East Africa</em>, is located exactly one floor below the iHub, Nairobi, co-working space and, John, this is basically skeleton right now, you&rsquo;re really bringing this vision of this incubation space to real life. Here as I see scaffolding up as the office kind of takes shape so, I&rsquo;m really kind of one of the early people here to really see this coming to fruition.</p>

	<p>How did it get started?</p>

	<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Hmm, so how it got started is the iHub and other partners formed a consortium sometimes early last year to bid for this expression of interest that was floated by INFODEV. Now, INFODEV is an agency of the World Bank. They wanted to set up mobile application labs in Africa, in Asia and other continents. So, this particular expression of interest was for the m:lab mobile application lab in Africa. And so, were lucky to actually win that particular solicitation. And so basically, the consortium is composed of the iHub which is upstairs, the University of Nairobi, ***EMOBELESE?*** which is a training institution in Kenya and the Web Foundation.</p>

		<p>So, basically, after winning the grant now, we are in the process of implementing the activities. One of the main things is to setup the business incubation centre. We were lucky to secure space just beneath the iHub which is very useful for us in terms of networking and community building.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>As well as talent acquisition.</p>

	<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Exactly! Actually, right now we can confidently say that the iHub is our pre-incubation space. And, actually a  number of events that are m:lab events would be done upstairs at the iHub. So, currently, we are in the construction phase to set up various facilities that include some seven business incubation offices, a testing suite (we are actually standing were it&rsquo;s supposed to be, we&rsquo;re still building out). Then, there is a training facility for twenty students and also a boardroom and meeting rooms that are breakout rooms for guys who want to go and do a negotiation in some quite space and things like that. So, basically, we are in the construction phase.</p>

	<p>We hope to have this done by say mid-May this year, around 17th May. That&rsquo;s when the contractor is supposed to have finished and were are meant to have site occupation.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>In May?</p>

	<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>In May.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>That is, <em>this</em> is fantastic! I would have to say this is, what you are doing, is definitely unheard of in East Africa. It&rsquo;s definitely <em>the</em> extension, the support service for all of those lone-guns up there at iHub who are dreaming up these fantastic applications.</p>

	<p>What kind of support would m:lab give a prospective, I guess you&rsquo;d call them an &ldquo;incubatee&rdquo;?, that you&rsquo;d bring under your wing here in m:lab?</p>

	<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>For this purposes, let me call it, let me call them the <em>incubation clients</em>. Like you have said, the m:lab is a natural progression of the iHub and really what&rsquo;s going to be happening is inasmuch as up at the iHub we have a mentorship program, a research program and networking events that help people to access markets and to access capital, the m:lab is a little more focused on mobile technology and also, there is a more elaborate program to provide business assistance to our seven &ldquo;incubatees&rdquo; or <em>incubation clients</em>. This involve mentoring, coaching on things like project management, things like legal advice, things like monitoring and evaluation of their projects.</p>

	<p>We&rsquo;ll also be helping, pretty much match-making, between these very talented organisations and venture capital people, seed funding and all sorts of possibilities for raising capital for their start-up projects to scale up to market.</p>

	<p>And, beyond access to finance, there&rsquo;s also access to markets. We are running the Pivot25 event. Pivot25 will be June 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> of this year. This is where we&rsquo;ll be running a competition of ideas around mobile technology. This competition has five categories with five companies that will be selected to pitch and showcase their ideas in that particular event in June. And it is in this event that we&rsquo;ll have a demo pit. We&rsquo;ll have these twenty-five companies demonstrate their products to this big audience of around four-hundred people that includes thought-leaders in the various m-health, m-agriculture, various aspects of the economy that can be assisted greatly by mobile technology.</p>

		<p>At the same time during this event we&rsquo;ll be inviting people that can provide funding, financing of those projects to scale up. So basically, it&rsquo;s a combination of various support services to these budding developers and tech entrepreneurs to be able to scale up their products and actually our vision is to first identify these start-ups that are very promising and to nurture them and to help them to become sustainable businesses; strong entities in the knowledge economy and so actually, we&rsquo;ll be happy when these incubatees or incubation clients graduate from our program two years from now into very strong entities that can compete not only in the East African Region but also globally in the mobile sector.</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>So, in terms of your personal involvement, can you give us a little bit of history of how you got in involved:
			<ol>
				<li>With m:lab and</li>
				<li>With tech in general in East Africa.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>So, I have a number of years experience, almost a decade of experience since I left school.</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Where did you go to school?</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>I went to school at the University of Nairobi&rsquo;s Computer Science School. So, after graduating, even before graduating, I was pretty much involved in software development. I did a lot of C++ programming before we graduated so I developed this enthusiasm for technology and especially software development. But once you go out there in to the job market, you realise that these things that you really like doing, like developing in interesting object-oriented languages and others, are not really what you end up doing in the normal corporate space. You end up being system administrators or things like that.</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Yeah.</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>So, I did some work. I&rsquo;ve had a few years of that kind of work that&rsquo;s not exactly development but on the side, I&rsquo;ve been doing my own development of applications.</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>So this has been the natural progression of your side-hustle?</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>(Laughs) &hellip; of my side-hustle! So, at some point I also started blogging about the technology scene in Nairobi and East Africa in general because I was mostly in the m-health/health sector, health/IT sector,
so I also developed a lot of interest in m-health.</p>

		<p>So, I&rsquo;ve been blogging for a number of, almost two years now, and in the process of saying a lot in my blog, I also got to know more about other bloggers, like Eric who blogs as whiteafrican. And that&rsquo;s when I also came to know about the iHub which is, well it's not that old so, I guess &hellip;</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>&hellip; yeah, it's quite new. Quite new.</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>So basically, in the process, I also realised that at some point since I was looking for a more exciting career out of the old, I was actually working for a government institution. It can be pretty boring inasmuch as you have very nice ideas of information systems that can help your organisation. So, when I landed this, an advertisement for the job to run the m:lab, I quickly applied and somehow I&rsquo;m here.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>You're here, now. Very short history of your involvement in to this field.</p>

		<p>But, in speaking of short, in the last two years has been <strong>massive</strong> development in the tech space not only in Kenya but in East Africa in general we see a lot of iHub-type co-working spaces that are cropping up in response to all of this connectivity that we have. All of a sudden, out of the woodwork you're seeing developers who were	previously working in their bedrooms, now they are seeing the opportunities. Bandwith has gotten massively cheaper in just the last eighteen months. You're able to download movies. There&rsquo;s mobile application development because now you have bandwidth that can actually feed all of these mobile applications. I would be, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be speaking too soon to say that we don&rsquo;t have enough applications to take actually take up all of this mobile bandwidth that we have here.</p>

		<p>What do you see over the next two years in Kenya alone?</p>

		<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Judging from what has happened in Kenya over the last one year. See the iHub, we just started the iHub, just slightly over a year ago. And with the iHub and the open space and innovation, there&rsquo;s been a lot of things that have happened in the last one year. So, if I'm to project for the other, the next two years &hellip;</p>

		<p>To begin with now the iHub has caused the m:lab to happen and the m:lab, for me, is going to change a lot of things. Being the natural	progression and now trying to formalise these relationships between developers and businessmen and investors. Now, the m:lab is what is really going to solidify that progress and then we can start having serious entities, companies &hellip;</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->
		<p>Coming out of all of these ideas &hellip;</p>

		<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Coming out of this, that are actually sustainable, because our incubation program will actually focus a lot on sustainability of your business. Things like project management, managing your finances. So, basically, we are going to churn out some strong companies that, even if you remove the iHub and the m:lab five years from now, then at least we'll have said that it was because of the iHub and the m:lab that you have these strong, ten or so very strong companies that are competing in the mobile space and not just in Kenya or East Africa but even globally.</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>And that brings me to my next question because in terms of other entries and other industries in Africa entering the global market, we have seen how difficult that is. For example, farming. Getting our products just to the EU or even to get them across to America has been very difficult for those farmers and entrepreneurs to actually access those very lucrative markets.</p>

		<p>In terms of digital, here on the continent, Ushahidi showed that something created here on the content can have massive effect and usage across the globe. Would you credit any of this enthusiasm to Ushahidi&rsquo;s success globally?</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Definitely, I will attribute a lot of what is happening right now in Nairobi&rsquo;s and East Africa&rsquo;s tech scene to Ushahidi&rsquo;s success because first it was a very clear demonstration that actually you can have globally, award winning products in ICT from Africa. That is actually made in Africa and actually addressing solutions that are not just our social-economic problems in East Africa but also problems outside there.</p>

		<p>So, as far as Ushahidi&rsquo;s contribution to the tech scene in East Africa, and Africa in general, I think that was a game-changing situation that happened for us. And then even that you realise that Ushahidi is pretty much what is keeping iHub running at this point in time when we are looking for iHub sustainability. So, I think even that	financial support for the iHub has changed a lot of things because the iHub in itself has got its own array of successes that are helping to change the tech scene.</p>

		<p>So, definitely, Ushahidi has changed a lot of things for us.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>That doesn't necessarily limit all the application that are being developed, that they have to have global scale and global usability in order to be successful. You can develop up programs for problems right here that don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be, you know, their measure of success doesn't have to be global distribution.</p>

		<p class="guest">
		John Kieti
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>No, I agree and disagree in the sense that since the world has condensed things into a very small space, the so-called global village. So, as you speak right now, I do not see what stops	a local app developer from developing a solution that is addressing the	local market, the East African market that does not meet global relevance or global standards. As far as standards is concerned, I don&rsquo;t think we have any more excuses because we have the bandwidth to, and we have everything that we need to be able to make sure that our products are meeting global standards.</p>

		<p>In terms of relevance to the markets out there, perhaps there could be a difference because there could be cultural, socio-economic differences but, it shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult for a local mobile development firm, it shouldn't be difficult for them to produce an application that addresses the needs of guys in Netherlands. Because it should be easy to asses the requirements of that market, in terms of their social-cultural settings and with a few partnerships with the guys out there, you can actually deliver a solution that addresses the needs down there.</p>

		<p>And that's not to say that things even things like gaming. Gaming tends to be a little less capital sensitive. So, it is indeed possible for applications to emanate from here that are directly addressing the needs of the global scene without much more customisation. But yes, I agree.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Let's talk about gaming specifically. Because I don't think many people look at the African market as the origin of, you know, really hardcore gaming or even casual gaming like on your phone as such. What would we need to kind of create a gaming culture here for games that are actually created here and as you said there don't necessarily have to have cultural relevance they just have to have a little bit of entertainment value that anyone can enjoy across the world in order for them to be relevant to that person.</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>One that that guys need to agree with is that gaming and entertainment is big business the world over and in East Africa also. So, we need to move away from that mentality that if someone is doing a game or if some one is doing a movie or music they are not contributing directly to the economy. There&rsquo;s a lot of money you can make around that. Not even having to sell the game outside East Africa but even within us. Very often you'll find someone is bored somewhere and they&rsquo;re browsing their phone to find a game to play or something.</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>If there is a game on their phone, that's usually the first feature they look in to.</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Really. So, if we are playing games that are put on the phones from somewhere outside there, why not also be able to play games that are developed within here. So, basically, I think, we also need to change that mindset that entertainment and gaming doesn&rsquo;t have much productivity value.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Or financial value.</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Or financial value, yeah. That's what I meant to say.</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Going on to of that, in order for gaming to be successful, you need a good distribution platform, right?</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Yeah.</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>In order to get it out there to other, to as many either, whether its handsets or laptops or computers that you want to get it on. How does distribution play in to the other apps that are developed here at m:lab? Do you look at that as a problem or something that has already been solved in the mobile space given the myriad of handsets that are out there?</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>I will say it hasn't been fully solved but there's a number of efforts around that. For instance, the Nokia guys with their Ovi store. There's alot of effort to push a few more applications in to the Ovi store that are actually originating from within East Africa. So, that&rsquo;s part of the solution.</p>

		<p>Direct downloads from our mobile carriers' portals. That's already happening. There are already games that can be downloaded from the portals at Safaricom and other and Airtel and other guys are setting up.</p>

		<p>So, in terms of distribution, indeed, it&rsquo;s been a problem but when you look at the current developments right now, it should&rsquo;d be a problem for too long and also for us as the m:lab and the iHub and other players, we'll also want to try and work with the mobile carriers and the platform vendors and their marketplaces and see how we can we can actually push for more applications on their stores. But if, when worst comes to worst we can always setup our own application store</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>This is true. So, why haven&rsquo;t you?</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>We are still studying the market. We don't want to rush in to it because a decision to setup our own market store is pretty much declaring that we want to actually rival other players. So, before we make that statement we want to first understand our market and a little bit of market research, but we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>I mean, yeah, like we talking about earlier that this area is very, very young. What we see right now on this show could be a completely different market place within twelve months. I mean, look where Ushahidi was. I mean, it was just three years ago and look where the space has come in to, right now in early 2011. So, whose to say what we&rsquo;re going to be able to see in 2015?</p>

		<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Yeah. Very interesting we came to this space two years ago. Just the general Nairobi tech scene. There was very little happening. It was just developers frustrated in their bedrooms &hellip;</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Yeah. Wanting to do something and not really knowing where to go with it.</p>

		<p class="guest">
				John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Yeah. There is no, their environment is not quite enabling. Right now the other thing that I must say has been contributing to the development of the tech space in Kenya is our ICT board, our government, really. They've been very, they've really facilitated innovation. The other day, they are currently implementing their first round of the local content and application grants where they give some money, actually grants. I believe it's from the World Bank, to motivate local companies to come up with applications and for, and also have local content on the web.</p>

		<p>I think that's one of the other things that has really been helping the tech scene. Especially, that one I'm saying for Kenya in particular. So, even, all sectors are responding. It&rsquo;s not just the iHub and a few private stakeholders. Even the government is helping a lot.</p>

		<p class="host">
				TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>So, it's basically buy-in from all sectors that actually believe in the potential of the digital space here in Kenya as well as East Africa.</p>

		<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Yes.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Now, given that do you forsee a trickle-down effect where, you know, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, they look at the this model, the iHub, m:lab what it's creating and say, "You know what? Hey, if they can do it, we can certainly do it". How long before the other countries start to follow or is there a need to follow, especially when m:lab is serving all of East Africa?</p>

		<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Actually, there is a need to follow and especially when we speak of such initiatives, they always need ownership and a little bit of customisation to that local context. So, the iHub and the m:lab are great and the m:lab will be trying to also reach out and spread out to serve the needs of the rest of the people in East Africa. But, they shouldn't, I think other people in other countries in East Africa, if they want to setup their own spaces like this, I believe it's very much welcome but I will advise them to come and have a look at what we are doing so that they do something better than what we are doing here. Or at least, we share some ideas and if there is any help that they might require, I'm sure we'd be more than willing to help them.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>OK. Alright. Well John, thank you so much for joining us on this episode of the Digital Continent Podcast. We look forward to seeing a lot more of what comes out of this space. I'm quite sure by the next time I come in the walls will be up, the glass will be up and there'll be a buzz of activity here.</p>

		<p>How many companies are you going to launch with here?</p>

		<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>The hard launch, the official launch, which we'll be having right after the Pivot25 event, we'll be be having four guys. But Pivot25 in itself will be helping us to identify three guys. So, during the actually launch we wouldn't have quite settled on the three that will be coming out of the Pivot25 event, but we'll be having four already resident.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>OK.</p>

		<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Yeah.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Perfect.</p>

		<p>And what's the deadline for anyone out there listening who would like to participate in Pivot25.</p>

		<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Pivot25, the competition is, was closed, submissions were closed on 15<sup>th</sup> of April. So, right now we are at that selection stage and basically we should tell the world about the twenty-five companies that will be presented at the event somewhere around April 31<sup>st</sup> or early May. So, basically, new submissions, I think are time-barred, for now.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Right. So, is Pivot25 something that will be happening annually?</p>

		<p class="guest">
			John Kieti:
		</p><!-- /guest -->

		<p>Yeah. Pivot25 is actually what we'll be billing as East Africa's mobile event. So that it will be happening every year. So, around June next year we'll be having yet another one. So, this particular one, I&rsquo;m sure there's a lot of lessons that we are learning that we'll want to plough back into the plan for the next one. So, we can be sure that Pivot25 for 2012, will be much, much more, bigger. But already the 2011 one looks, is looking very promising.</p>

		<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
		</p><!-- /host -->

		<p>Oh excellent. OK, John thank you so much for the work that you are doing here at m:lab and for Kenya as well as setting an example for East Africa. We look forward to talking to you more as m:lab matures in the coming months and years.</p>

		<p>And this has been TMS Ruge for the Digital Continent Podcast. We'll talk to you the next time.</p>
