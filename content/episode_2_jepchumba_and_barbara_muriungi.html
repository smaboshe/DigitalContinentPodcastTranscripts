	<h2>Episode Introduction</h2>	
	<p>Alright. Good afternoon everyone this is TMS Ruge, your host of the Digital Continent Podcast. Today, I'm actually really excited to be bringing you this particular episode from the offices of iHub, Nairobi. For those of you that don't know, iHub is probably <em>the</em> leading, what would I call it, technology hub, I would say, for geeks and freaks, geeks and digital freaks, basically, hanging out in Nairobi to wrangle code in to beautiful software applications and the like.</p>
	
	<p>Today, I'm excited to be, to actually talking to two very entrepreneurial ladies. One whom I have known for a long time and the other getting introduced to today as part of the team behind African Digital Art. So, without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to Jepchumba, who is the founder and Barbara Muriungi who is the editor. And, even after practicing her last name a few times, I have managed to butcher it one more time.<br />
	So, without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to these two ladies from African Digital Art.</p>

	<h2>Interview</h2>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>So, Jepchumba, let's begin with you. Tell me what African Digital Art is. Obviously you and I have had this relationship. Just to, you know, give a little bit of a background. We've known each other, I guess for a couple of years now in the online space. I think this only our second time? Second time of actually meeting physically. So, we, our relationship is basically digital. So, tell me, or tell our listeners how African Digital Art came to be.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Well, to start off, African Digital Art started out as an online space dedicated for digital media and arts in Africa. I was doing my masters degree in digital media at London and at the time, I knew that I wanted to focus on something that had to relate to where I was from which is Kenya, which is Africa. And I wanted to explore how creativity and technology intersect. And so, I was tasked with doing a dissertation project and I started doing research on digital media. And I was astounded by the fact that it seemed as though when it came to Africa, people just assumed, you know, there's nothing really going on and they kept on referring back to some Egyptian animation in the 1930s and said, (laughs) "This is it, this is what Africa has to offer". And I was completely baffled because I knew, you know, animators and photographers and digital artists. So, I began African Digital Art as a way to conduct my research and also to, you know, let other people know about the projects and things that people were doing. So, that's how it started and it kind of grew into something, completely different animal, really quickly. So, yeah.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Fantastic! I remember, I think, this is basically a project that has been born from three different continents, actually. From Europe and then you were in Chicago for a bit working on that. And then, every once in a while I'd see you here in Kenya or at least digitally hear that you were here in Africa working on it.</p>

	<p>Tell me how the reception has been for the site itself and the platform.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>So, at first when I began African Digital Art, I posted, I think I posted like five artists, digital artists. And I panicked. I was like is that it? (Laughs) Have I run through? I think you where one of the first people that I featured coz I knew about your photography and the things that you had been doing. And so, I was, you know, I had this attack, panic attack and I realised, no, there's a lot more. And, you know, people from the diaspora, especially, started approaching me and saying, "Hey, look!", you know, "I happen to work for Pixar but I'm actually from Senegal!" or, you know, "I'm working on the Avatar movie, I'm a digital painter and I'm from Kenya!". So, it was quite amazing to see, you know, the reception.</p>
	
	<p>And from then on I started finding out more and more projects and it kind of snowballed in to this really remarkable thing that, you know, to this day I'm really surprised at the kind of the projects that we feature and which led me to actually start African Weekly Inspiration which is, you know, dedicated to showing every week, new, fresh projects from different artists doing different things in different fields, you know. Just giving a different perspective of Africa that we were used to which is, you know, the starving child, or, you know, the famine, poverty and &hellip; you know, you know, <em>you know</em> (laughs) what I'm talking about, yeah!</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Yeah, the status quo, as it were.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Exactly!</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>And, you know, from the few times that I've actually visited, you know, the site over the few months, the past few months, you have really been growing in terms of the type of Artists that you're really featuring. It's really cool to actually see that we do have members of the African family, really out there especially within the diaspora, you know, it's a really passionate interest of mine that we actually have leading Africans within this space and it's really cool to actually see them being featured.</p>
	
	<p>How has the reception been here, on the ground where, I suppose, is really the actual audience that you want to engage with?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>As you mentioned before, I have been splitting my time traveling between, you know, being in Europe, the US and here and in January, actually, we started organising our first African Digital Art event here in Kenya. And we were kind of unaware of what the reception would be. We had kept in contact with the artists that were here but we really didn't know how many people would actually make it and show up. I think we expected around, you know, maybe 30 or 40 people and we had over 200 people come and more people who wanted to attend the event.</p>
	
	<p>So, the reception has been absolutely positive and its been something that, you know, a lot of artists have actually written to both of us and told us, you know, "Oh, my goodness, I've been living in isolation for so long as a creative person", you know, like, "I didn't know more artists like us existed", and, "I can't believe that African Digital Artist is there to inspire me and also to make me connect with other artists". And that's actually how The District, which is our kind of social networking component of the site started because we kept on getting so many emails of, "Look, I'm a photographer. I need to find a designer. How do I do that?", or, you know, "I'm trying to do this project. I don't know what I'm doing. How do I get in contact?". So, we, you know, started The District as a way for people to actually come and meet. And it's kind of strange, you know, in other places, you know, creative people are very, you know, find themselves in, you know, collaborative spaces but in Africa, a lot of us are living in isolation so it was good to provide that space online and then translate it here, in Kenya, offline.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>And, I'd like to switch over to Barbara actually. And one of the first things I'd like for you to do is actually correct my pronunciation of your name. And then tell us how you came about joining the team at African Digital Art?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Barbara Muriungi:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Ok. So, it's Muriungi but it's OK. That's fine.</p>
	<p>So, I, separately from before I met Jepchumba, had started a blog sort of in New York, where I was living at the time. And I focused it on what we call East African collective. And, so then, I was more or less focused on looking for artists or designers who lived in East Africa at the time Kenya, Uganda or Tanzania and sort of uncovering this bunch of artists. Most of them where in the diaspora but came from here. So, it was more or less like highlighting these are people that have looked at their work and I noticed their artists and no one else was sort of talking about them on the web. And so that's how Jepchumba found out about me is because I had a blog that started to feature, you know, designers and artists and there was a bit of sort of fashion, sort of introspective. And then, sort of, it took a year for use to actually grow this relationship before I jumped on in to ADA. So, it was more or less like, you know, she did something and I used to admire the work that she used to do but at the time I was still nurturing my little thing and then decided I should come on to ADA because I think the stuff that she'd done in a year was totally amazing and just, it blew me off because, like, I was like, this was remarkable.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Yeah, and if anyone was watching the evolution of the site and actually I remember Erik Hersman (if everyone that knows him and I'll be interviewing him later, in a later episode of here), he commented how impressed he was with how far African Digital Art community and the website itself had come.</p>
	<p>Now, your background is fine arts but you managed to wrangle code into a very respectful site. How did you do that?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>(Laughs) I don't know if I'm the most healthiest person actually coz of that. I guess, like, for the past two years I was living kind of like in a hole like. Just like, learning everything. So, I was kind of frustrated. I wasn't able to translate what was in my head to coders. And as I found myself getting more in-depth with my own technical skills so, I was like setting motion graphics and animation, I said, let me give coding a chance, like, let me see if it works out or not. And I felt like a certain urgency to respond to what the artists needed. So, I felt like I needed to catch up to what their needs where. So, with The District, I ended up learning how to code because I needed a site, like immediately, to get off the ground. And you know, till this day, I'm reluctant to mention I code because, you know, as a designer, you don't want to get in to that world at all so I kind of hesitate, I'm a secret, you know, I'm kind of a secret coder, even though right now I'm with AkiraChix which is a women-in-tech in Kenya group as well so, I think I'm coming out more and more.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Yeah, your definitely coming, you're coming of age, right at the right time.</p>
	<p>Now, tell us a little bit about, for all the techies that want to know, what platform that African Digital Art is running on.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Well right now African Digital Art is running on WordPress and The District is running on BuddyPress. And I kind of had to learn all. I mean, I think I was one of the first people who noticed BuddyPress was coming out before it did and I started learning more about it as, you know, more features were coming out, so &mdash;</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>I think we discovered it right round the same time.</p>


	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Yeah. Exactly.</p>
	
	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>And then I was watching what you were doing with it. I think one of my first experience with it was for a client, and I actually just designed the interface and then let the coders actually wrangle with the very, very beta code set that they were working with. But it's actually matured, BuddyPress has, over the last I think it's just over &mdash; has it hit 1.0 yet?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Yes. Yes, it has. (Laughing) It's kind of sad that I know that!</p>
	<p>Yeah, so, I mean, like, I mean, definitely moving forward, you know, coding is just going to be something that I know. Hopefully, I not going to be, you know, that much involved with it but, you know, that's another thing of, you know, letting creatives be aware of that there is a <em>humungous</em> opportunity on the tech side. And, you know, like I constantly have conversations with people who are more analogue, you know, in their work. And, like, you know, painters and sculptors and say, "Have you ever thought, you know, of using this kind of application, you know, just to draft and sketch?". You know, at first their usually skeptical but then when I show them the kind of work that other people are doing, you know, they get curious and interested and that's the exciting thing about digital media and that's why I'm so passionate about it because it's a way of merging, kind of, different ideas together and coming up with solutions pretty fast and seeing them, you know, come alive. So, you know, and I think that's why, also, we've been very encouraged to see the, you know, the work that's been going on at the iHub and, you know, like you mentioned, Erik, he's been incredibly supportive of what we're doing and actually, he's been encouraging us to, you know, bring more creatives this way and also think about, you know, having a space that connects, you know, the tech side and the creative side. And then, I think also, something that would be great, also, is an industrial kind of space as well, you know, and having those three things kind of intersect would be a powerful thing for Africa and, you know, the possibilities, yeah.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Yeah coz, I think that's really the missing link here in Africa because we hear about how tech is revolutionizing everything that we are doing from Mpesa to the crowd sourcing applications that have come out of Ushahidi which I've talk about endlessly. Really, when you want to look at a flag-bearing application for East Africa and Africa in general you can't go, you can't mentioning anything outside of Ushahidi.</p>
	<p>Which leads me to the other question because for <em>us</em> as interface designers, as front-end people, as, you know, the prettifiers of things that, you know, that work, I've really noticed it's something that is missing here in the African tech space is that front-end user interface make it, yeah, it works, you know, you can get it to work but does <em>anybody</em> want to use it. So, how long do you actually think before we really gain core competency in terms of design, not just application functionality but the top-end of it, the front-end of it. How long before we can really see that as a core necessity in the applications that we build here in Africa?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>You know that's an excellent question. It's actually something that, you know, I completely talk about constantly. I feel like I'm annoying people here at iHub, coz I'm like, "Where's the design! Where's the design!" and you know, I think people, when it comes to Africa have this tendency of saying, "It just has to function". It doesn't matter if it's ugly it doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense, it works, right? You know, we'll make it work, you know. So, that's something that has been frustrating, but I think I see just because of the work, the other work with ADA that I see everyday. And even if you just go wherever you are in different places in Africa, if you go to a crafts shop, there's design in everything that we do, you know so it's only a matter of time until that kind of comes together. And I think what is important is people to realise that, you know, design is not something, you know, an extra add-on. It actually helps, it actually translates in to, you know, you being successful, you finding an audience, you, you know, selling your product, you, you know creating solutions.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>And how serious people actually view your application.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Exactly, exactly, yeah. And it's something that also Barb and I have talked about, yeah.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Barbara Muriungi:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Yeah, it's been sort of frustrating to, sort of, approach somebody and, you know, they, design is not a forethought for them so it's more or less like, it's like four things down, you know. Even concepts or thinking more or less what's the big picture, what's the big idea is always like at the back of their minds. So there's not a "wow factor" with some of the things that we see here that are really useful. It's sort of there's always, it's technologically it's a good idea but behind it we're not impressed. And so, at end of the day, I think design has to come as more of a forethought.</p>
	<p>But we're trying, I'm trying to see also as a designer, like, how to make that connect to people. I think because even when you watch television here some of the channels are really frustrating to look at. And so it's sort of functionality is like what they think and then, sort of the formal how it works at the end of the day are two things that are sort of don't have that connection and I think because technology has helped us sort of get there at first so all we need to do is like this infrastructure to help us make all these things work. And then let's make it appealing, let's make it, you know, user friendly, let's make it simple are sort of like the behind thoughts which should also come hand in hand with, like, us guys having useful tools that help us engage with things that we need. So, yeah, I just think that that's sort of the common knowledge that needs to be passed on to people that, you know, functionality and design are together and not one comes before the other.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>And I think that is something that us, as members of the diaspora, can really appreciate is that approach is because we see it in the West, this holistic approach to delivery of product. It's what makes Apple great. It's what makes Nokia great It's what makes Google great is because they have to think about that. It's an expected kind of thing is because your application in an App Store of thousands, you know, really before anyone can even, you know, test the application, 1, it has to look good to them, it has to appeal to them, it has to have that attractive feature that says, "Ooh, let me take a look at this!", because as users, we are very visual, we're pulled in by that visual element and then it has to speak to us before it actually starts to work for us doesn't it?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Barbara Muriungi:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Yeah, I guess the response to that is that a lot of things here are, sort of, the competition is also very small and so a lot of people know something by its functionality and use and its sort of passed on as word for word or, so there's never, like, a fight
if something's <em>that good</em> we'll <em>all</em> know about it. And so if it needs to sort of trend-set or it needs to sort of come out of the merge and be spoken about there has to be something about it that attracts all of us and it's still a connection, I think, that the audience here needs to make together because I know that this is a country where, or a continent where people are attracted to good cause. They know functionality in terms of design. But there are those other things that sort of don't connect like how are the roads, are our roads useful, do we have road signs that work? Do we have, you know, like, the way you pay your bills, like all those other small things just don't connect together. So, I think design suffers because of that. Because of, we have things in the forefront that are sort of what is functional and useful and then behind it is just &mdash;</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Yeah, it seems &mdah; and that has triggered a thought to me, because when I look around, actually, when I look around, you know, in Dakar, when I'm there, when I'm in Kampala when I look around, when I'm in the outskirts of Johannesburg, when I'm in Nairobi on the outskirts, design is like the last thing. Even road signs, even roads, even in city planning. In all of that it seems like design to us is completely a foreign thing that, you know, us members of the diaspora and perhaps other visitors that come to visit. It's like mad chaos out there. Chaos, it's like chaos theory functions here, however you try to bring in design it's a completely foreign language. So, I'm looking at a systemic failure here in terms of appreciating design and two, I guess the question has to be asked: "Is design important in Africa?"</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->


	<!--- To be continued ... -->
	<p>That's an excellent question. Actually, we recently just posted, I just recently posted a post on African Digital Art about user education. And we did a design survey that asked African creatives, "What is the biggest constraint that you face?". And I was expecting people to say, "Adobe is too expensive", you know, like, "I don't know how to find, you know, Internet connection to upload my portfolio", like, "I can't afford a laptop" or, "The electricity goes off". No, that wasn't their biggest constraint. Their biggest constraint was user education; the fact that they felt incredibly frustrated when they tried to communicate to their clients and their clients did not understand why it was important. That a logo isn't just something you copy and paste from Google Images or, you know, when you are thinking about a website do you think about the colours and how it will influence its people and how it's about communication and everything. And I think at first, I was trying to respond, think about how I was going to respond to this, you know, the fact that creatives said that this was their biggest problem. And I realised that it's up to us as creatives to actually take responsibility and do the job of teaching our clients about our process and why we are passionate about the work that we do. And why it hurts our stomach when we see ugly websites and, you know, billboards that just don't make any sense, and  road signs that confuse other people, you know. <em>We</em> have to also start taking the initiative as much as people in technology have
Ushahidi have, you know, with civic engagement, we also have a responsibility to, you know, educate, you know, our communities about it.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Barbara Muriungi:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Yeah, another thing, sort of, has a path
New York, sort of had its had its
master designers
that information, sort of trickled down and so is the Swiss community
simplicity and it's the same thing
I think in Africa, we also
teach ourselves
filter through our language and so, it can mean that we simplify a lot of things so that they function even just for a few people and then they begin to sort of make sense to like the entire community because before
