	<h2>Episode Introduction</h2>	
Alright. Good afternoon everyone this is TMS Ruge, your host of the Digital Continent Podcast. Today, I'm actually really excited to be brining you this particular episode from the offices of iHub, Nairobi. For those of you that don't know, iHub is probably the leading, what what would I call it, technology hub for geeks and freaks, geeks and digital freaks basically hanging out in Nairobi
wrangle code in to beautiful software applications and the like.
Today, I'm excited
very entrepreneurial ladies. One
long time.
introduced to today as part of the team behind African Digital Art. So without further
Jepchumba, who is the founder and Barbara Murungi who is the editor. And, even after practicing her last name a few times, I have managed to butcher it one more time.
So, without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to these two ladies from African Digital Art.

	<h2>Interview</h2>

So, Jepchumba, let's begin with you. Tell me what African Digital Art is. Obviously you and I have had this relationship.
background. We've known each other, I guess for a couple of years now.
online space
second time of actually meeting physically
relationship is basically digital. So, tell me, or tell our listeners how African Digital Art came to be.

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

Well, to start off, African Digital Art started out as an online space dedicated for digital media and arts in Africa. I was doing my masters degree in digital media at London and at the time, I knew that I wanted to focus on something
where I was from
Africa
how creativity and technology intersect
dissertation project and I started doing research on digital media
astounded by the fact
Africa, people just assumed
nothing
going on
back to some Egyptian animation in the 1930s
this is it, this is what Africa has to offer
completely baffled
animators
digital
African Digital Art as a way to conduct my research
started
into something
animal, so, yeah.

	<p class="host">

three different continents
Chicago for a bit working on that
see you here in Kenya or at least
here in Africa working on it. Tell me how the reception has been for the site itself


	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

panicked. I was like is that it?
one of the first people that I featured
and so I was
panic attack
diaspora especially started approaching me
Pixar
Avatar movie, I'm a digital painter
amazing to see the reception
then on
projects
kind of snowballed in to this really remarkable thing that to this day
projects that we feature and which led me to start African Weekly Inspiration which is
every week new fresh artist
different perspective
starving child
famine, poverty
you know

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

Status quo

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

Exactly

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

cool to actually see that we do have members of the African family
really passionate interest of mine
leading Africans within this space and it's really cool
How has the reception been here on the ground
suppose
really
actual audience
engage with
travelling between
here and
in January actually we
organising
African Digital Art
kind of unaware
reception would be
kept in contact
really didn't know
actually make it
expected around, you know, maybe 30 or 40 people
over 200
reception has been absolutely positive
a lot of artists
written
isolation for so long
creative person
know more artists
us existed
can't believe
make me connect with other artists
actually how The District
component of 
emails of
look I'm a photographer
do that
trying to do this project

we, you know, started The District
strange, you know
creative people
but in Africa
isolation so it was good to provide that space online and then translate
offline

correct my pronunciation of your name
came about joining the team at 

	<p class="guest">
		Barbara Muriungi:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

East African collective
so then, I was more or less focused on looking for artists or designers
Tanzania
uncovering this bunch of artists
came from here.
highlighting
I noticed
no one else was sort of talking about
Jepchumba found out about me
started to feature designers and artists
fashion
introspective
sort of, it took a year
relationship before I actually jumped on in to ADA
admire the work that she used to do
decided I should come on to ADA
stuff that she'd done was totally amazing
blew me off
this was remarkable

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

remember
everyone that knows him
later, in a later episode
how impressed he was with how far African Digital Art
fine arts but you managed to wrangle code into a very respectful site

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

frustrated
translate what was in my head to coders
getting more
technical skill
motion graphics
let me give coding a change
if it works out or not
felt like
urgency to respond to what the artists needed
catch up to what their needs where
learning how to code because I needed a site
you know, to this day, I'm reluctant to
hesitate
secret coder, even though right now
as well so
coming out more

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:

right at the right time
what platform African Digital Art is running on.

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

The District is running on BuddyPress
before it did
started learning more about it as more
features were coming out

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:

watching what you were doing with it
client, and I actually just designed the interface
very, very beta code set that they were working with
over the last
thing it's just
has it hit 1.0 yet

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

kind of sad that I know that
definitely moving forward
hopefully
involved with it
thing of letting creatives be aware
tech side
constantly have conversations with
analogue in their work
painters
application, you know, just to draft and 
skeptical
show them
other people
and that's
exciting thing about digital media
passionate about it
merging
coming up with solutions pretty fast
you know, and I think
see the, you know,
iHub and, you know
incredibly supportive of what we are doing
creatives this way
think about
space that connects the tech side
creative side
industrial
three things
powerful thing for Africa

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

missing link
tech is revolutionising everything we are doing
crowd sourcing that have come out of Ushahidi
which
endlessly
look at
flag bearing
can't mentioning outside of Ushahidi.
other question because
front-end people
prettifiers of things
missing here in
tech space
front-end
user interface
works
anybody want to use is
before we really gain core competency in design, not just application functionality
how long before we can really see that as a core necessity
applications
build
Africa

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

iHub
where's the design
I think people
saying it just has to function
ugly
doesn't make sense
we'll make it work
that's something that has been frustrating
other work
see every day
just go wherever you are
go to a crafts shop
design in everything we do
that kind of comes together
what is important
design is not something
extra add-on
it actually helps
you know
successful
audience
selling your product
creating solutions

exactly

	<p class="guest">
		Barbara Muriungi:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

concepts
big picture
big idea
back of their minds
wow factor
see here that are really useful
always
technologically
not impressed
end of the day
come
more of a 
trying to see
connect to people
watch television here
frustrating to look at
sort of functionality
and then
form
works
two things
don't have that connection
technology
sort of get there at first so all we need to do
make all these things work
appealing
user friendly
simple
behind
come hand in hand with, like,
tools
engage with things that we need
common knowledge
functionality and design are together
comes before the other

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

see it in the West
delivery of product
what makes Apple great
Nokia great
Google great
have to think about that
expected kind of thing
application in an App Store of thousands
before anyone can even test the application
look good to them
appeal to them
has to have have that attractive feature
because as users
speak to us
work for us doesn't it

	<p class="guest">
		Barbara Muriungi:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

competition is
very small
functionality and use
word for word
never, like, a fight
something
all know about it
needs to sort of trendset
spoken about
attracts all of us
still
connection that the audience
needs to make
country
continent
functionality in terms of design
things that sort of don't connect
road signs that work
you know, like, the way you pay your bills
connect together
because of that
we have things in the forefront that are sort of

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

triggered a thought to me
you know
Dakar
Kampala when I look around
Johannesburg
Nairobi on the outskirts
road signs
city planning
all of that, it seems
design
foreign
you know
made chaos out there
chaos theory functions here
design
foreign language
systemic failure
in terms of appreciating design
is design important in Africa

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

question
African Digital Arti
Adobe is too expensive
don't know how to find
portforlio
laptop
electricity goes off
biggest constraint
user education
the fact that they felt incredibly frustrated
clients did not understand why it was important
Google Images
when you
thinking of a website
thing about the colours
communication and everything
at first
trying to respond
respond to this
creatives
this was their biggest problem
up to us as creatives
do the job of teaching
clients
process
work that we do
see ugly websites and
billboards
road signs that confuse other people
initiative
technology
Ushahidi
civic engagement
you know
educate

	<p class="guest">
		Barbara Muriungi:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

sort of
master designers
information, sort of trickled down
simplicity
same thing
Africa we also
teach ourselves
filter through our language
so, it can mean that we simplify
just for a few people
make sense
entire community
before
to someone
bigger picture
example
create
start
luminous
you know
walk into a supermarket
at any isle because they are well designed
walk in to a house
not so separated
function well
small ideas and just making sure that people
care about what they are doing
audience
sort of making those small, small examples
enable us to have
thought and conscience
bigger ideas
and time also as well

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

absolutely disciplined
stringent
terms
asking
demanding better design in the 
coders that we work with
myself
the way I work
break things
coders
I have to be stringent with them
works yes
but
looks like crap
not going to work
design police as it were
it is imporant
how we communicate that information
trickles down
coming digital age
our
generations that are coming up
smart phones in their pocket
this population is under the age of 15
boom that's coming on
leads me
is tat
what kind of design
really, right now, as you're design
need to be cognizant of the fact that we're designing for the next generation
education system

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

excellent question
new audience
they're not a dumb audience
as much as I am
same music
Chris Brown
exposed
global community
living
isolation
cool and what's not
advertisers are going to start paying attention to
translates
money
things that
executives and advertisers care about

	<p class="host">

???? Mumbles somthing ???

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

Exactly
mobile web design conferences
Africa's space
we have 
we're privileged enough 
skipped a step
through our phones
computer to go on to the Internet
you know, busted phone

way to think about our devices in a different way

going to be able to

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

necessarily
skip over
encounter designers
States and Europe
direction to take it
boxed in
most designers
obsessed with Apple
worshipping at the foot of Apple
nobody
mobile phones
different variations of Apple has done
iPhone really
other devices
open your mind to new opportunities
exciting thing to see
technology
new perspective
communicate differently
translate
creations will be great

	<p class="guest">

Mpesa
easily
money
lack

paying with plastic
became a way

now it will be

instead of making queues
sort of for East Africa

way to impact a lot of people

excited when I come home
find new designs for everything
candle holders

all sorts of things

gigantic
what sort of helps us
map where we are
success because
design solutions
different
as Jepchumba has said
made by hand
sort of
eco-friendly
design that people continue to do
continues to be
problem
that in itself
enable peoples lives to be much better
useful here
solutions for the web and utilising the Internet successfully for everyone
coming of age with
will happen.

	<p class="host">

trickle down
everyone I see here at iHub
needed access, right? Everyone has access
think about design
like to think
think about design
Jua Kali cookstove maker

essence of what
introduce
take design and
look at it
when you
he's been doing it for twenty-five years
make him think

this way
re-invent this thing
how
teach that person design.

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

through economy
communicate your invention
that means more people 
other invention
that means 
family and, you know
take care of your family
that's one thing that a lot of people don't really understand
sake of creativity
design is not just for the sake
art is not just for the sake of having a 
language that communicates with people
translates
how
if you change the colour of this and make it more appealing

does
I don't know what it is

one thing
turn into

unique functionality but also be used for
not just
maybe it can be a heater of some sort
using one item to do a lot more and I'm sure that with design and research
one unique thing
multiple reasons and people will benefit from it

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

want to make kind of clear
design is not owned by the West
like
exists there and hasn't come here
make that clear
misunderstood
does exist here
constantly
matter of making people understand the value of it

co-working space
founder of African Digital Art
Barbara
did good this time excellent
touch upon
too much noise about it
noticed as ladies in the tech space here in Africa
some ladies in the iHub
not nearly to the same degree as the men that I see here
I would have to say
stand out as women in the tech space
design-centric than code centric
space to yourself
Jepchumba
how does it feel

Wow

see myself
not super-aware that I'm the only female
when I do encounter
there is a lot of sexism in the tech space
