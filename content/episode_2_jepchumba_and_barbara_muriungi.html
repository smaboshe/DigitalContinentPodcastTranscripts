	<h2>Episode Introduction</h2>	
	<p>Alright. Good afternoon everyone this is TMS Ruge, your host of the Digital Continent Podcast. Today, I'm actually really excited to be bringing you this particular episode from the offices of iHub, Nairobi. For those of you that don't know, iHub is probably <em>the</em> leading, what would I call it, technology hub, I would say, for geeks and freaks, geeks and digital freaks, basically, hanging out in Nairobi to wrangle code in to beautiful software applications and the like.</p>
	
	<p>Today, I'm excited to be, to actually talking to two very entrepreneurial ladies. One whom I have known for a long time and the other getting introduced to today as part of the team behind African Digital Art. So, without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to Jepchumba, who is the founder and Barbara Muriungi who is the editor. And, even after practicing her last name a few times, I have managed to butcher it one more time.<br />
	So, without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to these two ladies from African Digital Art.</p>

	<h2>Interview</h2>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>So, Jepchumba, let's begin with you. Tell me what African Digital Art is. Obviously you and I have had this relationship. Just to, you know, give a little bit of a background. We've known each other, I guess for a couple of years now in the online space. I think this only our second time? Second time of actually meeting physically. So, we, our relationship is basically digital. So, tell me, or tell our listeners how African Digital Art came to be.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Well, to start off, African Digital Art started out as an online space dedicated for digital media and arts in Africa. I was doing my masters degree in digital media at London and at the time, I knew that I wanted to focus on something that had to relate to where I was from which is Kenya, which is Africa. And I wanted to explore how creativity and technology intersect. And so, I was tasked with doing a dissertation project and I started doing research on digital media. And I was astounded by the fact that it seemed as though when it came to Africa, people just assumed, you know, there's nothing really going on and they kept on referring back to some Egyptian animation in the 1930s and said, (laughs) "This is it, this is what Africa has to offer". And I was completely baffled because I knew, you know, animators and photographers and digital artists. So, I began African Digital Art as a way to conduct my research and also to, you know, let other people know about the projects and things that people were doing. So, that's how it started and it kind of grew into something, completely different animal, really quickly. So, yeah.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Fantastic! I remember, I think, this is basically a project that has been born from three different continents, actually. From Europe and then you were in Chicago for a bit working on that. And then, every once in a while I'd see you here in Kenya or at least digitally hear that you were here in Africa working on it.</p>

	<p>Tell me how the reception has been for the site itself and the platform.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>So, at first when I began African Digital Art, I posted, I think I posted like five artists, digital artists. And I panicked. I was like is that it? (Laughs) Have I run through? I think you where one of the first people that I featured coz I knew about your photography and the things that you had been doing. And so, I was, you know, I had this attack, panic attack and I realised, no, there's a lot more. And, you know, people from the diaspora, especially, started approaching me and saying, "Hey, look!", you know, "I happen to work for Pixar but I'm actually from Senegal!" or, you know, "I'm working on the Avatar movie, I'm a digital painter and I'm from Kenya!". So, it was quite amazing to see, you know, the reception.</p>
	
	<p>And from then on I started finding out more and more projects and it kind of snowballed in to this really remarkable thing that, you know, to this day I'm really surprised at the kind of the projects that we feature and which led me to actually start African Weekly Inspiration which is, you know, dedicated to showing every week, new, fresh projects from different artists doing different things in different fields, you know. Just giving a different perspective of Africa that we were used to which is, you know, the starving child, or, you know, the famine, poverty and &hellip; you know, you know, <em>you know</em> (laughs) what I'm talking about, yeah!</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Yeah, the status quo, as it were.</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Exactly!</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>And, you know, from the few times that I've actually visited, you know, the site over the few months, the past few months, you have really been growing in terms of the type of Artists that you're really featuring. It's really cool to actually see that we do have members of the African family, really out there especially within the diaspora, you know, it's a really passionate interest of mine that we actually have leading Africans within this space and it's really cool to actually see them being featured.</p>
	
	<p>How has the reception been here, on the ground where, I suppose, is really the actual audience that you want to engage with?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>As you mentioned before, I have been splitting my time traveling between, you know, being in Europe, the US and here and in January, actually, we started organising our first African Digital Art event here in Kenya. And we were kind of unaware of what the reception would be. We had kept in contact with the artists that were here but we really didn't know how many people would actually make it and show up. I think we expected around, you know, maybe 30 or 40 people and we had over 200 people come and more people who wanted to attend the event.</p>
	
	<p>So, the reception has been absolutely positive and its been something that, you know, a lot of artists have actually written to both of us and told us, you know, "Oh, my goodness, I've been living in isolation for so long as a creative person", you know, like, "I didn't know more artists like us existed", and, "I can't believe that African Digital Artist is there to inspire me and also to make me connect with other artists". And that's actually how The District, which is our kind of social networking component of the site started because we kept on getting so many emails of, "Look, I'm a photographer. I need to find a designer. How do I do that?", or, you know, "I'm trying to do this project. I don't know what I'm doing. How do I get in contact?". So, we, you know, started The District as a way for people to actually come and meet. And it's kind of strange, you know, in other places, you know, creative people are very, you know, find themselves in, you know, collaborative spaces but in Africa, a lot of us are living in isolation so it was good to provide that space online and then translate it here, in Kenya, offline.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>And, I'd like to switch over to Barbara actually. And one of the first things I'd like for you to do is actually correct my pronunciation of your name. And then tell us how you came about joining the team at African Digital Art?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Barbara Muriungi:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Ok. So, it's Muriungi but it's OK. That's fine.</p>
	<p>So, I, separately from before I met Jepchumba, had started a blog sort of in New York, where I was living at the time. And I focused it on what we call East African collective. And, so then, I was more or less focused on looking for artists or designers who lived in East Africa at the time Kenya, Uganda or Tanzania and sort of uncovering this bunch of artists. Most of them where in the diaspora but came from here. So, it was more or less like highlighting these are people that have looked at their work and I noticed their artists and no one else was sort of talking about them on the web. And so that's how Jepchumba found out about me is because I had a blog that started to feature, you know, designers and artists and there was a bit of sort of fashion, sort of introspective. And then, sort of, it took a year for use to actually grow this relationship before I jumped on in to ADA. So, it was more or less like, you know, she did something and I used to admire the work that she used to do but at the time I was still nurturing my little thing and then decided I should come on to ADA because I think the stuff that she'd done in a year was totally amazing and just, it blew me off because, like, I was like, this was remarkable.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Yeah, and if anyone was watching the evolution of the site and actually I remember Erik Hersman (if everyone that knows him and I'll be interviewing him later, in a later episode of here), he commented how impressed he was with how far African Digital Art community and the website itself had come.</p>
	<p>Now, your background is fine arts but you managed to wrangle code into a very respectful site. How did you do that?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>(Laughs) I don't know if I'm the most healthiest person actually coz of that. I guess, like, for the past two years I was living kind of like in a hole like. Just like, learning everything. So, I was kind of frustrated. I wasn't able to translate what was in my head to coders. And as I found myself getting more in-depth with my own technical skills so, I was like setting motion graphics and animation, I said, let me give coding a chance, like, let me see if it works out or not. And I felt like a certain urgency to respond to what the artists needed. So, I felt like I needed to catch up to what their needs where. So, with The District, I ended up learning how to code because I needed a site, like immediately, to get off the ground. And you know, till this day, I'm reluctant to mention I code because, you know, as a designer, you don't want to get in to that world at all so I kind of hesitate, I'm a secret, you know, I'm kind of a secret coder, even though right now I'm with AkiraChix which is a women-in-tech in Kenya group as well so, I think I'm coming out more and more.</p>

	<p class="host">
			TMS Ruge:
	</p><!-- /host -->

	<p>Yeah, your definitely coming, you're coming of age, right at the right time.</p>
	<p>Now tell us a little bit about, for all the techies that want to know, what platform African Digital Art is running on?</p>

	<p class="guest">
		Jepchumba:
	</p><!-- /guest -->

	<p>Well right now African Digital Art is running on WordPress and The District is running on BuddyPress. And I kind of had to learn all. I mean I think I was one of the first people who
before it did
started learning more about it as more
features were coming out
